Arq
===

Arq is a spec-driven AI coding tool that ensures developers understand their
codebase before generating code. It enforces a three-phase workflow: Research,
Planning, and Implementation.

Quick Start
-----------

    # Set your LLM provider
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OLLAMA_HOST

    # Create and run a task
    arq new "Add user authentication"
    arq research
    arq status

The Problem
-----------

AI generates code faster than developers can understand it. This creates:

* Knowledge debt that compounds over time
* Unmaintainable systems nobody fully understands
* Erosion of engineering judgment and pattern recognition

Arq solves this by enforcing understanding before generation.


Phase Documentation
===================

Detailed documentation for each phase:

* Research Phase: docs-concepts/research-phase.md
* Planning Phase: docs-concepts/planning-phase.md
* Agent Phase: docs-concepts/agent-phase.md


Core Principles
===============

Understand Before You Build
---------------------------

No code generation without validated understanding. Research phase ensures
the AI and developer share the same mental model of the codebase.

Human Decides, AI Executes
--------------------------

Architectural decisions happen in Planning, made by humans. Agent phase
only implements what was explicitly approved.

Spec as Contract
----------------

The plan.yaml is a contract. Agent is bound to it. Deviations are flagged.
No surprises, no scope creep, no hidden changes.

Transparency Over Speed
-----------------------

Every AI action is visible. Side-by-side comparison of intent vs output.
Conformance checking validates execution matches plan.


Installation
============

    cargo install --path crates/arq-cli

Or build from source:

    git clone https://github.com/AssahBismarkabah/arq
    cd arq
    cargo build --release


Project Structure
=================

When using Arq, artifacts are saved in .arq/ directory:

    project/
    ├── src/
    ├── .arq/
    │   └── tasks/{task-id}/
    │       ├── task.json         ← Task metadata
    │       ├── research-doc.md   ← Research findings
    │       └── plan.yaml         ← Approved specification
    └── arq.toml                  ← Configuration (optional)

These files are git-tracked, creating an audit trail of decisions.


Configuration
=============

Arq configuration in arq.toml:

    [context]
    max_file_size = 102400
    include_extensions = ["rs", "ts", "py", "go"]
    exclude_dirs = ["node_modules", "target", ".git"]

    [llm]
    provider = "openai"       # openai, anthropic, ollama
    model = "gpt-4o"
    max_tokens = 4096

    [storage]
    data_dir = ".arq"


Development
===========

Building from Source
--------------------

    git clone https://github.com/AssahBismarkabah/arq
    cd arq
    cargo build --release

Running Tests
-------------

    cargo test
