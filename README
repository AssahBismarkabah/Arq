Arq
===

Arq is a spec-driven AI coding tool that ensures developers understand their
codebase before generating code. It enforces a three-phase workflow: Research,
Planning, and Implementation.

Quick Start
-----------

* Install Arq extension in your IDE
* Click [Arq] tab to open workspace
* Enter what you want to build
* Research → Plan → Implement

The Problem
-----------

AI generates code faster than developers can understand it. This creates:

* Knowledge debt that compounds over time
* Unmaintainable systems nobody fully understands
* Erosion of engineering judgment and pattern recognition

Arq solves this by enforcing understanding before generation.


How It Works
============

The Workflow
------------

    1. User enters task: "Add rate limiting to API"
                    ↓
    2. Research Phase
       • Arq analyzes codebase
       • Finds dependencies and patterns
       • User validates understanding
       • Output: research-doc.md
                    ↓
    3. Planning Phase
       • Arq proposes approaches
       • User selects architecture
       • Arq generates spec
       • User approves plan
       • Output: plan.yaml
                    ↓
    4. Agent Phase
       • Agent implements spec
       • Conformance checking
       • User reviews code
       • Tests run
       • Output: Applied code


Phase Documentation
===================

Detailed documentation for each phase:

* Research Phase: docs-concepts/research-phase.md
* Planning Phase: docs-concepts/planning-phase.md
* Agent Phase: docs-concepts/agent-phase.md


Core Principles
===============

Understand Before You Build
---------------------------

No code generation without validated understanding. Research phase ensures
the AI and developer share the same mental model of the codebase.

Human Decides, AI Executes
--------------------------

Architectural decisions happen in Planning, made by humans. Agent phase
only implements what was explicitly approved.

Spec as Contract
----------------

The plan.yaml is a contract. Agent is bound to it. Deviations are flagged.
No surprises, no scope creep, no hidden changes.

Transparency Over Speed
-----------------------

Every AI action is visible. Side-by-side comparison of intent vs output.
Conformance checking validates execution matches plan.


Installation
============

VS Code
-------

    1. Install Arq extension from marketplace
    2. [Arq] tab appears alongside [Editor]
    3. Click to open Arq workspace

IntelliJ / JetBrains
--------------------

    1. Install Arq plugin
    2. Arq icon appears in sidebar
    3. Click to open Arq workspace

Other IDEs
----------

Arq adapts to native IDE patterns while providing the same experience.


Project Structure
=================

When using Arq, artifacts are saved in .arq/ directory:

    project/
    ├── src/
    ├── .arq/
    │   └── {task-name}/
    │       ├── research-doc.md    ← Research findings
    │       └── plan.yaml          ← Approved specification
    └── ...

These files are git-tracked, creating an audit trail of decisions.


Configuration
=============

Arq configuration in .arq/config.yaml:

    llm:
      provider: claude          # claude, openai, local
      model: claude-sonnet-4    # model to use

    integrations:
      slack: false              # enable slack context
      confluence: false         # enable confluence context

    testing:
      auto_run: true            # run tests after implementation
      command: "npm test"       # test command


Development
===========

Building from Source
--------------------

    git clone https://github.com/AssahBismarkabah/arq
    cd arq
    cargo build --release

Running Tests
-------------

    cargo test
